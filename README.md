## Experience

### Streamyard - July 2023 - Present

#### About

Streamyard is a live streaming platform that enables users to broadcast to multiple social media platforms simultaneously. I joined the team as a Senior Software Engineer, working across a number of teams to deliver new features and improve platform reliability.

#### Key Projects & Achievements

- Automated Audio Transcriptions - Developed a feature that transcribes audio from live streams, enabling users to add subtitles to their broadcasts. We used bleeding edge LLM transformers to achieve high accuracy, experimenting across a variety of accelerated hardware options to achieve a solution that was quick, accurate, and cost effective. Ultimately we were able to transcribe 1 hour of audio in less than a minute running on the GCP G2 family machine series (NVIDIA L4 GPU).
